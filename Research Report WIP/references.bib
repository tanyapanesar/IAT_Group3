    abstract = { In 1998, Greenwald, McGhee, and Schwartz proposed that the Implicit Association Test (IAT) measures individual differences in implicit social cognition. This claim requires evidence of construct validity. I review the evidence and show that there is insufficient evidence for this claim. Most important, I show that few studies were able to test discriminant validity of the IAT as a measure of implicit constructs. I examine discriminant validity in several multimethod studies and find little or no evidence of discriminant validity. I also show that validity of the IAT as a measure of attitudes varies across constructs. Validity of the self-esteem IAT is low, but estimates vary across studies. About 20\% of the variance in the race IAT reflects racial preferences. The highest validity is obtained for measuring political orientation with the IAT (64\%). Most of this valid variance stems from a distinction between individuals with opposing attitudes, whereas reaction times contribute less than 10\% of variance in the prediction of explicit attitude measures. In all domains, explicit measures are more valid than the IAT, but the IAT can be used as a measure of sensitive attitudes to reduce measurement error by using a multimethod measurement model. }

abstract = "I used the Implicit Association Test (IAT) to examine Chinese undergraduates' implicit attitudes towards their parents, with the aim of establishing whether or not these attitudes differed according to whether the parent was the father or the mother and also whether the young person
was male or female. Significant differences were found between participants' implicit attitudes towards their fathers, compared with their attitudes towards their mothers, regardless of whether self-reference or other-reference was used. Participants perceived that they had greater intimacy
with their mothers than with their fathers. There was evidence for gender dissociation under both other-reference and self-reference conditions.",

abstract = {The current study examined the validity of a happiness Implicit Association Test (IAT) as a measure of SWB. One hundred and fifty participants (75 pairs of friends) completed a newly developed happiness IAT and a standard self-esteem IAT. Participants also made self and informant ratings of life satisfaction and happy and sad affect. The results revealed convergent validity among the explicit measures, and among the implicit measures. Explicit–implicit correlations were lower. Self-ratings (.88) and informant ratings (.78) were more highly related with a common SWB factor than the implicit measures (.31). This finding suggests that implicit measures of well-being and happiness assess a different construct that overlaps only modestly with SWB. As a result, these implicit measures have limited utility to control for response styles in self-ratings of SWB.}

    abstract = { In two experiments, the use of a self-other Implicit Association Test (IAT) as a measure of implicit self-esteem was examined. In Study 1, participants completed two self-other IATs: one in which the other was unspecified and one in which the other was specified to be a close friend. Esteem-IAT scores were significantly higher for the unspecified other-IAT (d =. 82), indicating that the content of the other has a considerable influence on the over-all esteem-IAT scores. Study 2 provided a conceptual replication of these results and provided some initial evidence that the valence of an unspecified other is negative. Across both studies, the nature of the mental representation of the self, as measured by an esteem-IAT, changed as a function of the mental representation of the other. The crucial role of the other-associations in the esteem-IAT calls into question its use and interpretation as a measure of self-esteem. }
